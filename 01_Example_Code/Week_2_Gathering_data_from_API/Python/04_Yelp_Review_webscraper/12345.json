Dr Patel really helped educate me on everything involving my teeth and what's needed and despite one billing/insurance issue, I booked in my second appt in two weeks get going on some cosmetic improvement on my teeth (possible crowns or veneers). Yesterday I received an email saying I needed to get in touch with the clinic regarding my appt and that my number was disconnected, so I immediately replied with the best number to reach me that they could call anytime and also attempted to call the office 3X with no answer (during business hours)Then within a couple hours after the email the office manager emails me saying he's cancelled my appointment and all further appointments with the office. My appointment is still weeks away and I've just never dealt with a place that cancels you out as a future patient within a couple hours but is also impossible to get ahold of.I have replied to the two separate emails without any response still a day later- Im super confused about it and feel like I basically got fired as a patient which is weird because I was planning on spending thousands of dollars there. Bummed that I need to start completely over at another dental office now Business owner information Hardik C.

I get major anxiety visiting the dentist, but that quickly dissipated here.My regular dentist is closed and not answering any emails or phone calls and I had a concern about my crowns.It was easy to schedule a quick exam and cleaning and Maddy reached out via email to confirm additional details and information they needed.They are taking proper measures to ensure that they're being as safe as possible with COVID-19, which is reassuring.They were also just really friendly and educational. The hygienist gave me insight into my tooth pain that nobody had ever mentioned before (I have bad allergies and my sinuses can impact my tooth sensitivity). They also took photos of my teeth and actually went over my xrays and photos to make sure I understood what the doctor saw.They went over the patient plan and worked with my insurance, to make the whole process as painless as possible.Bonus: they offer Netflix on the tv while you're sitting in the exam chair. Looking forward to continuing with Enamel Dentistry."

From the quick paperless check in to the legit 7 minute painless cleaning, the customer service was on point and made me feel comfortable. My jaw pain and crooked tooth always bothered me and they presented an easy, affordable solution and answered all my questions. Within 3 weeks my smile will be perfect and jaw issue gone. Ive never been to an office that was so high tech and helpful with my issues. Shout our Dr Gaj - best dentist out there. His taste in music is ok too"

They overcharged my wife without her consent, using a picture of my credit card without my permission, for future procedures she hadn't confirmed were happening (for both of us, not just her), blamed us, scheduled the appointments and when I showed up for one of them said they gave the appointment to someone else because I didn't confirm by phone or text within 24 hours. The problem is that I received a text two hours before my appointment literally reminding me that I had that appointment and to show up for it, not asking for confirmation. They have continually acted with disrespect for us as customers in terms of our time, money and even applicable local laws, and we will not be going there any more. A shady experience all around - avoid at all costs."

Years ago, I had one dental office that set the bar, and after moving from city to city, no one has even come remotely close...except Enamel! Dr. C is an absolute GEM! He's personable, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. Usually, you might see the dentist for 2 seconds at the end of a cleaning, but Dr. C. took his time with visually walking me through my x-rays, talking to me about my concerns and making me feel completely at ease. I had some cavities between my teeth that needed filled, and I'm not going to lie...it was an intense process, but Dr. C. made sure I was comfortable and made it as quick and tolerable as possible. Aside from the top notch actual dentistry aspect, they have an awesome office, Rokus with Netflix in every room, a \"smile menu\" with things like WINE and BEER, scented warm towels, neck pillows, etc. This is the experience that everyone should have in any kind of medical/dental office - it makes it more bearable (dare I say...fun?!) and it makes you feel like you're a priority and not just a patient. Something to take the edge off..."

            "ReviewText": " This place is great for cleanings, well I assume they can handle that. I didn't let them do my cleaning after I had some issues with a broken crown. I went in pre quarantine for a cleaning. The doctor said that I had a cavity and need a crown immediately. He said it was urgent so I asked him if it would be best to wait until we saw what was happening with covid due to possible infections. He said it was urgent so I decided to do it. During the procedure he was typing on his computer with his gloves on and putting his hands in my mouth. I had to tell him that was nasty af. We continued with the treatment and got a temporary crown put in.I was scheduled to go back 2 weeks later to get my real crown put in and then they cancelled my appointment due to the lockdown. Which I knew would happen but my doctor insisted that they would be open. They are essential. Nope. I had a temporary crown in my mouth for a total of 7 weeks. The crown was molded by their entry level tech guy so when he fit the temporary crown it broke in my mouth at their office. He just added some paste and said it would hold for now. The whole experience was just horrible. I went to them because I live within walking distance, I have never had a bad experience with a dentist before so this was my first. I would let them do cleanings but I highly recommend to go to a different dentist for anything else. I was fine waiting for them to reopen during the quarantine, I get it. Global pandemic and all. But their staff handled my treatment poorly. Not once did they check in, there was no urgency on their end. They didn't care about my treatment at all. It was just a few grab for them. They wanted to make sure I got the treatment done regardless of any impact on my health. That was apparent when the dentist was using the same gloves he was typing with as he was in my mouth."

The staff is friendly and there are multiple reminders about the appointments. The office did have flat screens with Hulu/Netflix but I suspect remotes are banned for the time being. Dr. C is very concerned about his work and did a very thorough follow up to my crown that quickly resolved an issue I was having. Only bit of advice to the owners is to consider the aesthetics of the floor baseboard, the concrete seems to be a bit rough in places and could make it hard to clean going forward."

            "ReviewText": " One of my fillings fell out and I found this dentist office through Yelp. My first impression was that the office had just opened. The X-ray machine is in the front and there were empty tv boxes in a few of the rooms. The woman who took the photos of my teeth kept catching the camera on the back of my teeth as she yanked it out of my mouth. Surprisingly though, the office has been open for 3 years. The other thing that I really didn't like is that if you don't confirm your appointment, they cancel it. I got 2 voicemails on Thursday saying if I didn't confirm my appointment by noon Friday, they'd cancel the appointment. I didn't listen to them until late Friday but they didn't even give me 24 hours notice. I got the text message on Saturday asking me to confirm so I did and thought everything was ok. Come Monday, I found out that my appointment had still been cancelled. My doctor, gyno, hair stylist, and everyone else charges fees if you miss an appointment but they don't cancel it if you don't confirm....The last straw was the pricing. After insurance, my cost for everything would have been $2200 and that was in-network costs. I went to a second office to price check and for the exact same plan, the second office charged me less than $1000. The dentist was nice and informative but he's not worth going back to this office."

Second visit was with a new nurse and she wasn't confident about what she is doing and seemed kind of scared. I don't want someone to try their skill on my jaw especially when I'm suffering from a severe jaw pain. Doc suggested a night guard for the pain and guess what they forgot to take the impressions. I realized it in the parking lot so, had to go back in again. Now, third visit - the night guard. It wasn't a perfect fit so, Dr. Hardik did some adjustments. The weirdest thing - he didn't clean it well before letting me try it again and again (and I asked him to clean it more than twice). All the acrylic particles in my mouth, it was GROSS!! It wasn't clean when even they handed it to me. And I'm charged me $50 more for the night guard than what they told me before. I wish they had cleared it with me beforehand. Overall, it's a very typical business facility where they would be very nice on your first visit and after that they don't care much.Updates - My last visit was really good with Dr. Hardik. He adjusted the night guard so it feels better now."

The cleaning didn't take forever and the x rays were soooo fast, I was in and out of there in about an hour and that was WITH having one cavity filled.

The dental hygienist and Dr. Patel took the time to explain step by step what they were doing, which went a long way in alleviating the nervousness I felt when I walked in.I also appreciate how attentive the staff was. Even though my appointment was at the end of the day, everyone was just as thorough and patient as if it had been at the beginning of the day. Every person I interacted with checked in with me to find out if I had questions or concerns and seemed genuinely interested in making sure I had a good experience. \u00a0Thanks so much, y'all, for being great at what you do!

Netflix availability in the chair was a big plus of course as were the drink offerings I didn't partake in.

As mentioned in another post, Enamel is located in the '04, practically next to Matt's El Rancho and Soup Peddler, so already winning bonus points there. Additionally, they offer beverages upon entering the office, which are all free (ok, paid with a smile)! Plus, they have cool \"bad boy\" President and famous persons paintings, which decorate the hallways of their office. AND, as a new office, they're currently raffling prizes to new patients. I had my first appointment at Enamel Dentistry yesterday, and as much as I don't like going to the dentist, the staff made me so comfortable even before I arrived. I spoke with Dr. Chodavadia (Dr. C) on the phone a few times before coming in, and even though I had to change my appointment twice, he just laughed and joked with me and never got annoyed. Also, I was surprised that Dr. C did my dental cleaning and not an assistant. That was pretty cool, as typically, other dentists spend about two seconds talking about my teeth after the cleaning. I wouldn't say the cleaning itself was enjoyable (I've learned I don't love visiting the dentist), but Dr. C tried to make sure I was comfortable and would briefly stop and check in to make sure I was okay during the cleaning. He also thoroughly went over my X-rays.I think what I especially loved is that Enamel was never trying to \"sell\" me anything. They didn't swish my mouth with fluoride (and then request $20 payment), nor did they give me the Invisalign or braces schpeel, even though I probably need it. Finally, their prices are incredible, and they have a crazy inexpensive family plan. Check them out on SoLa!"

Dr. Patel was very friendly and knowledgeable about his craft. The seats were comfy, the TV was great, and he was even able to pull up my X-Rays on the giant screen so I'd be able to look at them with him without craning my neck. Dr. Patel was extremely thorough in examining my teeth and discussed a few options with me for further care. I'll definitely be coming back in a few weeks to continue my treatment plan.After my cleaning, I was given a warm, lavender-scented towel to wash up. Spa, I tell you!

He didn't try and actually told me why he recommended not doing additional work... I found my new dentist and am happy to have my next appointment prescheduled for 6 months from now. My wife also went to enamel but saw dr. C. She was equally happy with him."

            "ReviewText": " Enamel Dentistry is a new office that is located in one of the most attractive areas of Austin. The 78704 Lamar Zip Code is home to everything Austin, so it makes sense the best dentists also decide to open a new practice there!I was privileged to be one of first patients there, and any doubts I had of a new practice (I know we all get jitters when we decide to switch our providers!) were quickly gone. Dr. Patel & Dr. Chodavadia dedicate both of their efforts to make sure absolutely everything is going well. They will go out of their way to consult, exam, and target problem areas. They do not rush anything and can even suggest preventative care to make trips to the dentist less severe.Both dentists are extremely knowledgeable as well- I found this to be extremely important. I am someone who likes to pry and just keep asking questions, and they gracefully held quite a lengthy conversation with me on the practice of dental medicine. The maturity of this practice screams 20+ years of service. The office itself is beautiful. Alot of natural light, floor to ceiling windows- and great decor. You get a true lux feel, without the lux cost. They worked with my insurance, and even gave me a great special for their Grand Opening. I can confidently say this place cares more about quality than quantity. I would highly recommend this group to everyone, and those looking to switch away from corporate providers or poor quality dentistry. They are extremely flexible, worked with my schedule, and even offered early morning cleanings. (SO REFRESHING!)CHECK THEM OUT! I know i'll be back regularly for my cleanings!"

            "ReviewText": " One of my friends recommended me this place, so I took a chance to visit the Enamel Dentistry from my regular Floss Dental. In my opinion, Enamel Dentistry is brand-new have decentralized cumbersome dental visit experience. Types of equipment are top-notch, and quality of products and technology seems the state of the art. The team is relatively young, so they bring a positive aura of passion and commitment. This team wants to help you and being a patient that means a lot to me. Right from the warm homely greeting at the reception to choose one's favourite program on TV makes the overall experience gratifying. Before coming here, I knew that I had few cavities and a root canal issue underlying. Dr. Devish Patel and his team were professional to look into the recommendation from floss dental and advised me an excellent step-wise treatment plan to deal with all the issues. In my first visit only Team took care of all my cavities - I like their technology setup where they show you your panoramic x-ray and go over tooth by tooth to show you where exactly they are going to work and why the procedure is needed. Doctor took care of all my trivial questions, and I must say I never got such attention to the details ever before. My previous dentists were more interested in making money rather than helping me with troubleshooting my underlying issues. Moreover, Dr. Patel was so cool that I even added him on my facebook. I have shifted my regular cleaning visits from Floss to Enamel Dentistry. I would highly recommend this place to you Yelp readers. Furthermore, I sincerely wish this Dr. Patel and Dr. Chodavadia for the Enamel Dentistry."

I never felt pressured to agree to additional treatments and the financial stuff was very clear. Plus, they offered different payment options--something that not a lot of dentists offer other than applying for credit. I haven't completed my entire procedure but so far, so good. I feel like I am in good hands and Dr. C made the experience as easy and comfortable as getting a crown can be. He was the only dentist when I went in but the team was working efficiently to get through the appointments. It never felt like my procedure was rushed though, and I appreciated that.The office itself is really nice. It was clean, modern-feeling, and all the other things a dentist's office should be (and then some). I like that everyone there seemed to really enjoy their job and that made me feel confident in their work. I recommend this place to anyone with or without insurance, and especially to anyone who is wary of the dentist in general."

I HATE the dentist-- so much so that I lived with a temporary crown for a year because I just could not go back and take another moment in that chair. I think I've written 1 Yelp review in my entire life but I happily make this addition to the roster.My molar broke and my temporary crown came off within days of each other and Dr. C got me in right away after I filled out the online request form. He took extra care to make sure I was comfortable, helped me avoid a root canal, and I watched Netflix the entire time. Afterward we put together a treatment plan to fix both of my crowns and fill some cavities. They were all super willing to work with my financial situation to make sure I got treatment without breaking the bank and they even helped me navigate some weird claims from my former dentist. Overall, I would say go here without hesitation. I have a few more visits left for my treatment plan and I'm actually looking forward to going!"

The bedside manner of both the techs and Dr. Patel and the receptionist Zandra is outstanding. Every time I go it is just a really enjoyable experience, which is a crazy thing to say about going to the Dentist.

Enamel Dentistry immediately helped me out by sending me to have a root canal done at this location(enamel dentistry S Lamar)and it was absolutely painless and took less than 30 minutes. I had a crown put in at the other location (Enamel Dentistry Parmer Park) first a temporary and then a permanent a few weeks later and I have to say it was again absolutely painless and a \u00a0very good job Great work and very professional business.

We live in Dallas and come to Austin for he's dental needs because he feels comfortable with Dr Patel. He has lots of anxiety when it comes to getting work done on he's teeth but the moment we walk in everyone is so nice and comforting. My husband loves the headphones, and I enjoy the Netflix. They have tons of comforting items which makes the visits even better!!"

Styled like the type of place you'd expect from Austin! I had Dr. C and (I believe it was) Monica, who were both so thorough, compassionate, and enthusiastic. They make you feel extremely comfortable here and capable of trusting them to not put you through a miserable teeth cleaning or pocket pick you afterwards. I've always dreaded the next dentist appointment, but I don't find that feeling necessary anymore."

They had me fill out all of my paperwork online before walking through the door which meant I didn't have to wait for anything before getting started. These guys were so quick I didn't get to enjoy the excellent selection on their comfort menu (local beers/wine/pillow/blanket). But best of all their schedule caters to working professionals. I didn't have to take time off from work to get an appointment since they're actually open after 5pm.The service was great too. Dr. Patel did not just my fillings but also my cleaning (rather than an assistant/hygeinist). He taught me a new easier way to floss that's made the process so much easier for me. He also clearly walked me through all of his recommendations, but wasn't pushy like other offices I've visited before. On the whole they're really professional and friendly, and I'd happily recommend them to everyone. For once I actually look forward to coming back for my follow-up appointment later this year."

They advise. You decide. Cons: They don't have a Denver clinic where we are moving/I didn't get the warm lavender cloth after my appointments. hehehDetails below. Read on.  MAIN REASON. The main reason why I chose to go to Enamel Dentistry is, for obvious reason, \u00a0the ratings and the CONSISTENCY and COHESIVENESS of the reviews written about them. Sometimes you read the reviews on YELP and the reviews are all at odds and it does not make sense. The reviews about Enamel are just the same - they are awesome, provides good and quality service and they are the number 1 dental clinic in Austin. After reading thoroughly almost all the reviews, I decided to email them. I was busy with some paperwork then so I had to email. Nicole answered me right away and was very informative and clear with her reply. I signed up the \"new patient form\" from the website and it was all set. \u00a0The day after i signed the \"new patient form\", Nicole called me to say that there is something wrong with the insurance information I gave. She found a glitch with the info I gave and acted upon it. I have lived in 5 countries so I know customer service in different context. Nicole has raised the bar!Reception. \u00a0My husband and I arrived ten minutes before our appointment. Nicole greeted us with her beautiful morning smile, not a grumpy face that says you are an inconvenience. Nicole went through the paperwork, did confirmation re: our medical records and asked us if we need something to drink. They offer a menu for drinks and some comfy things like a pillow, warm lavender towel and all sort of complimentary stuffs.Clinic Tour. An equally nice and beautiful Brittney came to show us around the clinic. It was nice to see the whole facility. Having the tour made me not only see the actual room I was in for my teeth cleaning but to see all the other places. And boy, the whole place is squeaky clean. Literally, I can lay down in their WC's floor if I want to. No exaggeration.The teeth cleaning.I started with an x-ray using this really high tech machine. It was fast. Brittney did a good job. I went into this nice room - comfy chair, beautiful interior,great view of the street, really high tech medical machine/apparatus - and my teeth was checked one by one through a thorough x ray/3d imaging. Brittney and Dillon was a great tandem in making it possible to have an overview of the condition of my teeth and gums. They were very hospitable offering Netflix on the TV, something to drink and so gentle while they dig through every corner of my gums to get the x ray/3d. \u00a0Dillon was very good in explaining what he is about to do. Few minutes after, Dr.Patel came and explained what he has seen from the x ray/3d imaging. He was very eloquent in explaining the over all health of my teeth & gum. Since I have eaten a lot of chocolates sweet mangoes when I was a kid, \u00a0I have done 2 root canal and some other stuffs (poor me...hehehe), I was advised to do a \"deep cleaning\" instead of a normal cleaning. My husband was very satisfied with his normal teeth cleaning. He said that it was nicely done.I came back after few days to have my deep cleaning. True to its word - it was really a DEEP cleaning. Imagine body scrub, deep pore cleansing and \u00a0deep tissue muscle thai massage.You can equate those to Dr. Patel's teeth deep cleaning. Every teeth - its nook, curves, gum hold and all that - he did what he needed to do to clean it, polish it and make it in the best condition. Dr. Patel didnt rush it. \u00a0He was very intentional with every pull, scrub, and polishing he did. He was very kind in explaining in what he was about to do. He was always asking if I was feeling okey or I felt any pain. Excellence and Sincerity= middle names of Dr. Patel. :)While I had my deep teeth cleaning, I overheard Dr. Hardik, on the other room, many times asking his patient if she/he is okey. That's servanthood, people. Rare trait at this time. FOLLOW UP.They send several text reminders before my appointments. It is nice to be reminded.It has been a day since I had my deep teeth cleaning. Dr. Patel (the man himself, not some automated voice) called to check on \u00a0my condition - gum, teeth and all that. I missed the call but he left a VM. \u00a0I appreciate the follow up call they do for their patients who need an extra teeth attention. GIVEAWAY. They gave us two goody bags - toothbrush, toothpaste and floss. And the bag is cute. __Thank you Enamel crew for a wonderful service we have received from you. One of my highlights in living in Austin (less than a year). Sounds crazy but it is true! :"

I appreciate them keeping to their word and hope that you do not have a bad experience if you decide to visit them. I know, for sure, you won't have an issue with anybody who works there because they are very nice and as I have experienced, correct any mistakes that may have happened. UPDATE:: not even 10 mins after writing this review, the dentist I had the bad experience with called me and apologized. He then provided a way to help resolve the billing issue. I definitely appreciate this gesture and hope that this attention to detail showcases that their practice has been improving. The rating is going up now to reflect their willingness to improve and for their gesture to resolve the billing issues. **Original**The dentist I saw at Enamel Dentistry was constantly making mistakes. I had to come back multiple times in order to get my cap installed correctly...and he still didn't do it right. They try to make it seem like they are professional but only appear to focus on buying new dentist tools they never know how to use. After hesitating when he realized he made another mistake and there was a gap between the teeth(the floss should have stuck better between the teeth when pulling it out as he mentioned), he let me go. There was still a gap and he let me go even though this caused additional issues since the cap was set incorrectly. Instead of going back and have them work on my teeth more, I simply stopped going and requested that they stop reaching out. Now, about two years later I am getting a bill for services that were way below any standard I have experienced. When I attempted to pay this bill, their new online payment system does not give you any indication you have successfully paid. Yet another tool they have invested in that is more show than substance. I would recommend anybody else other than this team. Stay away."

            "ReviewText": " I'll start by saying the 3 stars has more to do with me and not Enamel Dentistry. By way of background, I am 40, had been seeing my same dentist for about 10 years, when she had to unexpectedly close her practice. Thus, I sought out a new tooth fairy. I chose Enamel based in part on the high reviews and its location because it is close to my work and my home. I gave it 3 stars because I found the office kind of stressful. Being located at Lamar and Manchaca, you can hear and see the roar of cars as they speed by. Music is on (great playlists) but so is the TV. These comforts should put you at ease, but I didn't know where to look or what to listen to..The colors are purple and green - bright and lively and cool. But, not terribly calming to me.The office offers a comfort menu - consisting of wine, beer, and scented towels. However, they were never offered, and I didn't ask if they were really available. The hygienist was young and was courteous. However, her courtesy slipped into the unsure for me \"are you asking me if you should measure my root pockets\" or \"are you telling me you are going to measure my root pockets\" Either way, I want the professional to take the lead and then be open to questions if I have them.I took lots of x-rays. I never saw them. And, I'm unsure if my dentist did either. In the end, this place is solid. I'm sure they are using all of the latest technology. No part of my treatment hurt. My teeth felt clean. I just think I am too old for this place. I' m going back to the basics: see Barton Springs Dental Group."

They have a more 'modern' take on the dentists office: you can get everything from coffee to beer to a hot towel while you wait (and my wait was not long), and they have TVs with Roku hooked up in every office so that patients can put something on to be distracted by during their appointment. Pretty cool."

It feels good to be greeted by that kind of confidence at the dentist office! Dr.C and Dr.P run a great practice. Psst! Dr.C has the low down on the best pizza places in town. Fast, Efficient, Professional and Great Bedside Manner. They cover most PPO plans. I have an HMO so I paid out of pocket but gladly. Prices are reasonable and they were able to squeeze me in same day for a broken crown. Dr.Patel was upfront and gave an honest assessment. He devised a game plan to get the tooth fixed and was sensitive to my budget. Office staff is wonderful and I've got nothing but great vibes coming from there. Read more"

When he was flossing my teeth I noticed he would miss at least the last tooth, sometimes the last two. And when he was do the left so much debris still in my mouth. I ended up having to use the floss kit that every dentist gives you to take home, in this Dentist's bathroom to floss and rinse my own teeth. I was in there an additional 5 minutes cleaning my own teeth post cleaning with the dentist. I usually leave a dentist feeling super clean and satisfied. I left this one feeling gross and disgruntled. Luckily everything was covered by insurance so I didn't have to pay anything. Had I had to pay out of pocket for an experience like that, I would be beyond annoyed."

When you walk in, Stephanie will offer you the 'Comfort Menu'. Should have taken a pic to post but, WOW! Impressive! The staff goes above and beyond to welcome you and make sure you are comfortable. No more filling out tons of forms on paper. It's all set up on an iPad and is very easy to follow. When entering the back, Dillion will take you on a quick tour of the facility, which I appreciated and was treated like a guest, not a patient. Dr. Chodavadia is very professional and extremely thorough. He made sure that I knew exactly what I was dealing with and although some of the work that I needed could be done there, he referred me to a Specialist that he knew could take care of my immediate issue. I will definitely go back for the work he can do once my issue is resolved. Dr. Patel, whom I only met, was extremely professional, pleasant and welcoming as well. A very warm atmosphere that helps create a gentle feeling that they are there to take care of you. I never once felt like I was getting service done on a vehicle (lol), (telling me something that I needed but did not). No issues with my insurance either. I highly recommend this dentistry for numerous reasons. Both Dr's. Chodavadia and Patel go out of their way, as does the entire staff, to make you feel like you're their only patient and they sincerely care about your dental wants and needs. From cleanings to dental cosmetology, this is the place to go! You'll definitely notice that you are treated differently. Not like a $ sign. If you're looking for a new dentist or are new in town, go to Enamel. You can thank me later!"

However, upon going in I was immediately told about their contest where you are entered for a flat screen TV for leaving a 5 star yelp review :| Honestly the environment isn't the most professional. Everyone there is so young and they almost try to appear too 'cool'. I've had the dentist explaining how to do things and what things mean to the nurses/hygienists many times and they always seem to be questioning themselves, it isn't very assuring. I also have never had a cavity in my life but when I came in I was told I had 12???? I still agreed to get them filled but in hind sight I definitely would have gotten a second opinion. When the fillings were done my jaw was so hurt by the injections that I literally couldn't open it fully for weeks. I also had to go back in later because it was still hurting so badly and there was just an open area that didn't get filled! My final straw was when I agreed to be fitted for a night guard. They completely messed up my imprint during the fitting. When I came back it wasn't even close to the shape of my mouth. I should have gone somewhere else well before this, I just think people should know what they are in for. Great experience, really nice facilities and the dentist explained everything to me in a very personable and friendly way. Even gave you the Netflix remote while you were sitting in the chair!

From the moment you walk into their office, it's obvious that they put a great deal of thought into every single detail. Their customer service is definitely noteworthy, and their state of the art equipment makes us look forward to every visit. For my son and daughter, one of the best parts is being able to watch a movie while they are working on their teeth. Of course, that's after they've had a chance to update their doctor on what they've been up to since they now see them as family. As always, Doctor Patel and Doctor C listen attentively as they excitedly share their newest adventures. -We've seen the office grow through the years, but our visits continue to be outstanding. This is the one place that you will be excited to visit and can count on leaving with a smile! Never thought that I would say that about a dental office, but it's true. We are truly grateful that we found such an amazing place and would definitely recommend Doctor C and Doctor Patel to anyone looking for a professional, experienced dental team with the most advanced technology available."

So there's nothing to clear up Dr. Patel. I cleared it up already. I'm just glad I had people in my family encourage me to get a second opinion. I think your office is really cute. I just think you might need some more experienced dentists in there. Even if they don't work on the patients, they should be reviewing the files before additional treatment is done. Dr Patel may be trying to pay for his kids college fund LOL. He insisted on 3 crowns and 2 fillings w no symptoms from me. Got a second opinion and all were rejected besides one filling. I think all the 5 star reviews are because if you write one, you get free whitening trays. If that's all you're after then fine, go. But not for serious issues. They've only been there 2 years. Maybe if you judge a dentist by a \"tour\" of the facility, a \"comfort\" menu offering tea and coffee, and Netflix on a big screen at your personal chair, you're impressed. As an adult with a long term view of my dental care, I don't care about those \"perks\". I care about safe conservative treatment. Crowns affect you FOR LIFE.

Duyen has such an attention to detail when cleaning and she is SO GENTLE! She stops to explain any questions or concerns you have, as well as explain why things might be the way they are. For example, I had no idea that I grind my teeth. Apparently just from my xrays she could tell! So happy to know why that's such a huge deal and how to prevent any significant damage. DR. C was great. He went over the different pictures of my teeth and of course the xrays. He let me know what might be a concern and to keep an eye on. Just warm and friendly. Dentists and doctors can be (albeit, understandably) so busy seeing so many different patients, and while they're typically always polite and professional, I can say with confidence that Dr C and everyone at Enamel not only possess these traits, but they are friendly!

It is our office policy to have a set of X-rays for any new patient, whether it be ones that we take or ones that the patient gives us from a previous office - it allows us to establish a baseline of a patient\u2019s dental health. I can assure you it is not due to financial motivation as we often waive the associated fee with patients that are not eligible due to insurance restrictions.

Buy their electric toothbrush with bluettooth, buy the flossing kit, buy the mouthguard, and make sure you come back in a few weeks so we can sell you even more stuff you don't need! Business owner information Hardik C. Business Owner 3/29/2017 Rob,First and foremost, I would like to apologize for you experience at our practice. We started our practice in order to serve our patient to the highest quality of care while making sure that each patient's treatment is catered to their specific needs. \u00a0The last thing that we want is for our patients to feel like they are getting \"sold\" on things that they do not need. We try to be as transparent as possible when discussing what treatment needs to be completed and why it is necessary. Our goal is to make the patient an active participant in their oral health so our job as a dentist is more of an advisory role.You did mention that we tried to sell you a toothbrush, while we do offer an electric toothbrush at our office we sell them at cost (which is often lower than what is available in retail) to help our patients, we do not make a profit on this. We do not sell any \"flossing kits\" nor have we ever sold any floss or flossing aides at our office. Often times we refer our patients to Amazon if we feel as though it may help our patients improve their oral health, and I can assure you Amazon does not cut us in. Anything we recommend is to help our patients improve their health, I apologize if it came off as us trying to sell you anything unnecessary that was not our intent. If you ever need anything from us or have any problems, please do not hesitate to reach out! Thank you,Dr. Devish Patel and Dr. Hardik Chodavadia Read more"

With that said- I know when a dental professional is good or not. Well... I just had my teeth cleaned and was very pleased with the experience. 1) Thorough- \u00a0Dr. Patel took time/energy to ensure my problem areas were treated with care2) Informative- I define a good dentist/hygienist when they educate you about proper techniques along the way. Dr. Patel ended the appointment by teaching me how to properly floss. This may seem rudimentary but only 30% of people floss and most people don't know how to floss. Therefore, education is key.3) Comfort- Both dentists will go out of their way to ensure your comfort throughout the process with their unique offerings including a pillow.4) Passion/Knowledgeable- Recent graduates tend to have state of the art machinery, passion for that they do, and a brain full of fresh knowledge- all of which you will see at Enamel Dentistry.Overall- I highly recommend you get your treatment at Enamel Dentistry. You won't be disappointed."

And she was getting help from her colleagues also.4. Doctor Patel looks to me so hurry and rushy to move next patient and one time he went for few minutes also. And he finished his talk quickly with me and moved to the next patient without saying any thing to me regarding that you can check with front desk so then front desk lady asked me about are you ready to check out but I said that don't know b/c nobody tell me.

I still see a dentist in philly. \u00a0I literally fly like two thousand miles to go see my dentist who I think is about 110 years old now. I own a business behind the Ceilo building and saw this place open. So I decided to give them a call and see if I could get my teeths cleaned. The lady who answered the phone was super nice and got me in the same day. I got there and the place is beautiful. The front desk lady offered me a beer. What!!! A beer? Only in Austin. Of course I said yes. What a good idea maybe I should start handing out beers at my office. I forget his name but a really nice guy gave me a tour of their office and took some x rays. The dentist, \u00a0who was not 110 years old, \u00a0was super cool. I have never had the actually Dentist clean my teeth before usually a hygienist does the clean and the Dentist just checks out my mouth for like 5 second. But at this office the actual Dentist cleaned my choppers. This place is awesome. They have a new client promo for $88 (or something like that) for first cleaning. \u00a0Totally worth it. I'll see you guys in 6 month when the choppers need another polishing."

Big shoutout to all the front office staff, who greeted me, sometimes even by name, and were super patient as I figured out payment!!"

TV's in every room with Netflix, complimentary beverages and good music! Text message reminders for upcoming appointments and Dr Patel called me personally to check-in on me after I had a crown put in. Never changing dentists again!"

They have state of art instruments and utilizes latest technology to help patients. I strongly recommend this dental group , they just began their practice in Austin, I am sure pretty soon there will be waiting list to get their appointments."

They had an amazing office staff and Dr. Patel was amazing. I am so lucky I was able to find such an amazing dentist being from out of town. I highly recommend his office. I wish I lived in Austin!!!"

From the moment you enter ENAMEL and NICOLE greets you you know your going to be in good hands, Dr C is amazing, I had a broken tooth, soon I had a temporary cap, no pain,. After fitting new crown Dr C said he didn't like its fit and he would redo at no cost. Did that today. I have to say Dc and his whole team is amazing, friendly, professional even coffee and other liquid refreshments. And I mustn't forget all the very latest equipment in spotless surroundings."

There are awesome hipster paintings of the Presidents around the office. The staff is extremely friendly and make visiting the dentist well worth it! They have reasonable prices for their services. The Dentists and assistants are great and walk you through each step during your visit. I'm very excited to have found a great new Dentist office in Austin! One of the friendliest and nicest group of people I've met! Thank you, Enamel!!"
